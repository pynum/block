1. Initialize a Private Blockchain:
The first step is to initialize a private Ethereum network by creating a Genesis Block, which defines the initial state of the blockchain, including network ID, block time, mining difficulty, and pre-allocated accounts.
Create a Genesis Block configuration file (genesis.json):
{
  "config": {
    "chainId": 101,   
    "homesteadBlock": 0,
    "eip150Block": 0,
    "eip155Block": 0,
    "eip158Block": 0
  },
  "difficulty": "400",  
  "gasLimit": "8000000",
  "alloc": {
    "0xYourAccountAddressHere": {
      "balance": "100000000000000000000" 
    }
  }
}
chainId: A unique identifier for your private network (different from Ethereum Mainnet or Testnet).
difficulty: Mining difficulty. Set it low for private networks to mine blocks faster.
gasLimit: Maximum gas limit per block (determines transaction capacity per block).
alloc: Pre-allocates Ether to certain accounts for testing purposes.
Initialize the Blockchain using the Genesis Block file:
geth init genesis.json --datadir ./myPrivateBlockchain
This will create the directory for the private blockchain and initialize the chain with the provided Genesis block.
2. Start the Private Ethereum Node:
Once the Genesis block is created, you can start your private Ethereum blockchain node:
geth --networkid 101 --nodiscover --datadir ./myPrivateBlockchain --http --http.port 8545 --http.api "personal,db,eth,net,web3,miner" --allow-insecure-unlock console
--networkid 101: Specifies the network ID (from the Genesis file).
--nodiscover: Disables automatic discovery of peers (useful for private networks).
--http: Enables HTTP-based access for interacting with the node via RPC.
--http.api: Allows access to certain APIs for interacting with the Ethereum node.
console: Launches the Geth interactive JavaScript console.
3. Create Ethereum Accounts:
In the Geth console, create an account to use in your private network:
personal.newAccount("YourPasswordHere")
This will create a new Ethereum account and print its address.
4. Start Mining Ether:
To mine Ether on your private blockchain, start the mining process by running the following command in the Geth console:
miner.start()
This will start mining new blocks and reward Ether to the accounts participating in the network. You can check your balance using:
eth.getBalance("YourAccountAddressHere")
To stop mining, use:
miner.stop()
5. Sending Transactions:
Once you have mined some Ether, you can test transactions by sending Ether from one account to another.
Unlock your account:
personal.unlockAccount("SenderAccountAddress", "PasswordHere", 15000)
Send a transaction:
eth.sendTransaction({from: "SenderAccountAddress", to: "RecipientAccountAddress", value: web3.toWei(1, "ether")})
This will send 1 Ether from the sender’s account to the recipient’s account.
6. Connecting Multiple Nodes:
For a more complex setup, you can connect multiple nodes to simulate a real network environment. Each node must have the same Genesis block and network ID.
Start the second node with a different data directory and port:
geth --datadir ./secondNode --port 30304 --networkid 101 --http --http.port 8546 --http.api "personal,db,eth,net,web3,miner" console
Add Peers:
In the first node's console, add the second node as a peer using its enode address:
admin.addPeer("enode://SecondNodeEnodeAddress@127.0.0.1:30304")
Now, both nodes will be part of the same private Ethereum blockchain.
